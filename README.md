# Certificate Generator
A script to generate bulk certificates for any event from a given template

During the covid pandemic, the world shifted almost everything to online mode. All the lectures, events, workshops are being held online. Seminars are transformed into Webinars.
People/Students started losing interest in attending these online events. So, to encourage them, the organisers started providing certificate of participate to every participant.

But it is difficult for an organiser to generate certificates manually for a large number of participants.

This Script solves the problem by automatically generating certificates for all the participants.

The Script takes a list of names, a .ttf(True-Type Font) file and a certificate template as input. It creates certificates for all the names using the template and saves it in the `./output/` folder
